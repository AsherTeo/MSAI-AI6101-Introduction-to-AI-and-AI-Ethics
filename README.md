# MSAI-AI6101-Introduction-to-AI-and-AI-Ethics

There are three assignments in this modulue. 

The first assignment, which consists of 50%, required us to train a model to control the robot(A) to push the box(B) to the destination (G) using reinforment learning. For this assignment, I used Q-learning and SARSA as my solution and further imporve by experimenting Epsilon value and learning rate. To enhance the performance, I make use of adaptive learning rate to prevent overfitting and also experimented Eplsion decay. 

The second assignment, which consists of 20%, required us to write an essay. The question can be found below. "Moral philosophy is traditionally subdivided into metaethics, normative theory and applied ethics. What are the possible ethical standards that we find described in normative theory and how might they provide 
guidance on the AI research front"
