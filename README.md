# MSAI-AI6101-Introduction-to-AI-and-AI-Ethics

There are three assignments in this module.

The first assignment, which consists of 50%, required us to train a model to control the robot(A) to push the box(B) to the destination (G) using reinforment learning. For this assignment, I used Q-learning and SARSA as my solution and further imporve by experimenting Epsilon value and learning rate. To enhance the performance, I make use of adaptive learning rate to prevent overfitting and also experimented Eplsion decay. 

The second assignment, which consists of 15%, required us to write an essay. "Moral philosophy is traditionally subdivided into metaethics, normative theory and applied ethics. What are the possible ethical standards that we find described in normative theory and how might they provide 
guidance on the AI research front"

The last assignment, which consists of 30%, required us to think of an AI application and apply one of the AI Responsible Practices such as Fairness, Private Preservation and Explainability.
